BABEL :- Babel is a JavaScript compiler that allows developers to write modern JavaScript 
        code (using ES6+ features) and transpile it into a version of JavaScript that can run in 
        older browsers or environments
        EX:- // Input (ES6)
            const greet = () => console.log('Hello');

            // Output (ES5)
            var greet = function () {
            console.log('Hello');
            };

Webpack :- Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes all the 
            assets in your project—JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, etc.—and combines them into 
            a single or multiple bundles. This ensures that your application is optimized for loading in a browser.


package.json :- The package.json file is a central configuration file in a JavaScript project.
                It is created when you initialize a project with npm init or yarn init. It contains metadata 
                about the project and manages the dependencies, scripts, and settings for the project.

node-modules :- The node_modules directory is a core component of a Node.js project.
                It stores all the dependencies (packages) required for the project.
                These dependencies are installed when you run npm install or yarn install, based on the package.json file.
